# oxyromon 0.1.0

Rusty ROM OrgaNizer

OxyROMon is a cross-platform opinionated CLI ROM organizer written in Rust.
Like most ROM managers, it checks ROM files against known good databases.
It is designed with archiving in mind, as such it only supports original and lossless ROM formats.
Sorting can be done in regions mode, in so-called 1G1R mode, or both.

### Configuration

Environment variables:
- `ROM_DIRECTORY` (required): full path to your ROM directory
- `TMP_DIRECTORY` (optional): full path to a temporary directory for file extraction, see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html) for the default value

### Directory Layout

    ${ROM_DIRECTORY}
        тоб .oxyromon.db # SQLite database 
        ...
        тоб ${SYSTEM_NAME} # Base directory for each system, allowed regions will be stored here
            тоб 1G1R # Sub directory for 1G1R games
            тоб Trash # Sub directory for trashed games
        ...

### External programs

- 7z: 7Z and ZIP support
- chdman: CHD support
- maxcso: CSO support

### TODO

- Write tests
- Support NKIT and NKIT.GCZ (NKIT is currently broken on Linux for Wii games)
- Have convert-roms optionally handle one game at a time

## oxyromon

    USAGE:
        oxyromon [SUBCOMMAND]

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    SUBCOMMANDS:
        help            Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
        import-dats     Parses and imports No-Intro and Redump DAT files into oxyromon
        import-roms     Validates and imports ROM files into oxyromon
        sort-roms       Sorts ROM files according to region and version preferences
        convert-roms    Converts ROM files between common formats
        purge-roms      Purges deleted or moved ROM files

## oxyromon-import-dats

Parses and imports No-Intro and Redump DAT files into oxyromon

The standard Logiqx XML format is supported, this includes Parent-Clone DAT files.

Supported DAT providers:
* No-Intro
* Redump

Note: Some systems require a header definition to be placed alongside the DAT file.

    USAGE:
        oxyromon import-dats [FLAGS] <DATS>...

    FLAGS:
        -i, --info       Shows the DAT information and exit
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    ARGS:
        <DATS>...    Sets the DAT files to import

## oxyromon-import-roms

Validates and imports ROM files into oxyromon

ROM files that match against the database will be placed in the base directory of the system they belong to. Most files will be moved as-is, with the exception of archives containing multiple games which are extracted.

Supported ROM formats:
* All No-Intro and Redump supported formats
* 7Z and ZIP archives
* CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data)
* CSO (Compressed ISO)

Note: Importing a CHD requires the matching CUE file from Redump.

    USAGE:
        oxyromon import-roms <ROMS>...

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    ARGS:
        <ROMS>...    Sets the rom files to import

## oxyromon-convert-roms

Converts ROM files between common formats

ROMs can be converted back and forth at most one format away from their original format. That means you can convert an ISO to a CSO, but not a CSO to a 7Z archive. 

Supported ROM formats:

* All No-Intro and Redump supported formats <-> 7Z and ZIP archives
* CUE/BIN <-> CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data)
* ISO <-> CSO (Compressed ISO)

Note: CHD will be extracted to their original split CUE/BIN when applicable.

    USAGE:
        oxyromon convert-roms [OPTIONS]

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    OPTIONS:
        -f, --format <FORMAT>    Sets the destination format [possible values: 7Z, CHD, CSO, ORIGINAL, ZIP]

## oxyromon-sort-roms 

Sorts ROM files according to region and version preferences

Sorting can be done using several strategies. You can also choose to discard certain types of games. Optionally you can print a list of games you may be missing, you hoarder, you.

Supported modes:
- Regions mode
- 1G1R mode
- Hybrid mode

In regions mode, games belonging to at least one of the specified regions will be placed in the base directory of the system.
In 1G1R mode, only one game from a Parent-Clone game group will be placed in the 1G1R subdirectory, by order of precedence.
In hybrid mode, the 1G1R rule applies, plus all remaining games from the selected regions will be placed in the base directory.
In every mode, discarded games are placed in the Trash subdirectory.

1G1R and hybrid modes are still useful even without a Parent-Clone DAT file, it lets you separate games you will actually play, while keeping original Japanese games for translation patches and other hacks.

    USAGE:
        oxyromon sort-roms [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

    FLAGS:
        -a, --all                   Sorts all systems
        -m, --missing               Shows missing games
            --no-beta               Discards beta games
            --no-debug              Discards debug games
            --no-demo               Discards demo games
            --no-program            Discards program games
            --no-proto              Discards prototype games
            --no-sample             Discards sample games
            --no-sega-channel       Discards sega channel games
            --no-virtual-console    Discards virtual console games
        -y, --yes                   Automatically says yes to prompts
        -h, --help                  Prints help information
        -V, --version               Prints version information

    OPTIONS:
        -g, --1g1r <1G1R>...          Sets the 1G1R regions to keep (ordered)
        -r, --regions <REGIONS>...    Sets the regions to keep (unordered)

## oxyromon-purge-roms 

Purges trashed and missing ROM files

This will purge the database from every ROM file that has gone missing, as well as optionally delete all games in the Trash subdirectories.

        oxyromon purge-roms [FLAGS]

    FLAGS:
        -y, --yes            Automatically says yes to prompts
